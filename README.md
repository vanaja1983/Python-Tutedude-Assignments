This repository has codes that are written as the part of assignments of tutedude's python course.

ASSIGNMENT 1:
Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations(Arithmetic operations on two numbers.py)
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting(Greetings.py)
1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.


ASSIGNMENT 2:
Module 3: Control Structures in Python
 
Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.
   
Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop 
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.

   
ASSIGNMENT 3:
Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python 

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 
1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
o   Square root of the number
o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
o   Sine of the number (in radians)
3.   Displays the calculated results.
