This repository has codes that are written as the part of assignments of tutedude's python course.

ASSIGNMENT 1:
Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations(Arithmetic operations on two numbers.py)
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting(Greetings.py)
1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.


ASSIGNMENT 2:
Module 3: Control Structures in Python
 
Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.
   
Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop 
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.

   
ASSIGNMENT 3:
Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python 

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 
1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
o   Square root of the number
o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
o   Sine of the number (in radians)
3.   Displays the calculated results.
   
ASSIGNMENT 4:
Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python
 
Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors 
1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
2.   Prints its content line by line.
3.   Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.

ASSIGNMENT 5:
Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python

Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
1.   Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
2.   Asks the user to input a student's name.
3.   Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
4.   If the student’s name is not found, display an appropriate message.

Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing 
1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
3.   Reverses these extracted elements.
4.   Prints both the extracted list and the reversed lis
